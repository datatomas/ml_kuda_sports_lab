# This script uses Playwright with the Stealth plugin to perform web scraping in a way that mimics a real browser more closely,
# helping to bypass common bot detection techniques like User-Agent checks, WebDriver detection, plugin enumeration,
# WebGL fingerprinting, and other browser property inspections. However, bypassing *all* possible signals (such as advanced
# behavioral analysis like mouse movements, keystrokes, or TLS fingerprints specific to certain setups) is extremely challenging
# and often impossible without additional tools like proxies, CAPTCHA solvers, or human simulation libraries.
# For many sites, this approach will suffice, but for heavily protected ones, consider using managed scraping services like ZenRows or ScrapeOps.

# Installation instructions:
# pip install playwright playwright-stealth
# playwright install  # Installs the required browsers
