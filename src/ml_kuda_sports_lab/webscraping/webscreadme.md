Web Scraping Knowledge Repository
Overview
This repository serves as an educational resource compiling knowledge on web scraping techniques, libraries, services, and bot detection signals. The focus is on understanding concepts for informational purposes only, not for practical implementation. All information is summarized from general discussions on anti-detection methods and defensive strategies. This is particularly tailored to scenarios like scraping sports-related sites (e.g., MMA fighting sites), where data such as fight schedules, stats, or results might be targeted. Remember, web scraping should always comply with legal terms, robots.txt, and site policiesâ€”bypassing protections can lead to ethical and legal issues.
Key sections include:

Libraries and Services: Purposes, usage notes, main plugins/extensions, and related tools like cookie blockers.
Bot Detection Signals: Common indicators sites use to detect automation, with relevance to sports sites (e.g., high request rates for live updates).
Ethical Risks and Preventive Uses: High-level summaries of risks and how defenders (e.g., site owners) leverage this knowledge.
Best Practices for Educational Understanding: Tips on building conceptual "strong scripts" without code examples.

This is purely for learning; no code is provided.
Libraries and Services
This section summarizes libraries and services commonly discussed in web scraping contexts. Each includes purpose, high-level usage notes, main plugins or extensions, and integrations like cookie blockers. For MMA sites, these could conceptually help handle dynamic content (e.g., live odds or fighter profiles) but emphasize education over use.

Purpose: Masks automation fingerprints in Playwright to make browser automation appear more human-like.
Usage Notes: Integrates with Playwright for Node.js environments; applies stealth evasions during browser launch to alter detectable properties.
Main Plugins/Extensions: Often paired with extra-stealth for advanced evasions; supports cookie management via browser context APIs.
Cookie Blockers/Related: Use with libraries like tough-cookie for handling sessions; blockers like uBlock Origin can be simulated for realism.
Relevance to MMA Scraping: Helps with sites using JavaScript-heavy pages for fight stats; focus on fingerprint integrity.

2captcha / AntiCaptcha APIs

Purpose: Outsourced CAPTCHA solving services to handle human-verification challenges.
Usage Notes: API calls submit CAPTCHA images/text; services use human solvers for responses; integrate via HTTP requests.
Main Plugins/Extensions: SDKs for Python/Node.js; browser extensions for auto-submission.
Cookie Blockers/Related: Often used post-cookie setup; pair with session managers to avoid triggering more challenges.
Relevance to MMA Scraping: Sports sites may use CAPTCHAs for high-traffic events like live fights; note latency issues in solves.

Ethical Risks and Preventive Uses
Summaries by Library/Service

playwright-stealth: High risk (evades fingerprints); Defenders: JS property validation.
selenium-stealth: High risk; Defenders: Navigator anomalies detection.
2captcha/AntiCaptcha: High risk (outsourced solving); Defenders: Solve latency scoring.
fake-useragent: Medium risk; Defenders: UA-IP consistency.
undetected-chromedriver: High risk; Defenders: TLS vs JA3 mismatches.
mouse-recorder/humanize-input: High risk; Defenders: Micro-movement modeling.

General Preventive Uses
Defenders use this knowledge for integrity checks, risk scoring, and adaptive challenges. For MMA sites, focus on behavioral signals for interactive content and rate limits for live data to build resilient systems conceptually.
Best Practices for Educational Understanding
To conceptualize a "strong script" for learning:

Combine stealth libraries with signal evasions (e.g., rotate UAs, simulate inputs).
Handle cookies/sessions for stateful sites.
Use proxies to avoid IP flags.
Randomize behaviors to mimic humans.
For MMA: Focus on low-volume, respectful scraping; understand dynamic JS for real-time data.
Always prioritize ethics: Check terms, use APIs if available.
